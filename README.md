### PHP is a programming language that can do all sorts of things: evaluate form data sent from a browser, build custom web content to serve the browser, talk to a database, and even send and receive cookies (little packets of data that your browser uses to remember things).

### Even though this can be done with Javscript, it generally runs on browser, or client side.This means it only really knows what's going on in your browser, plus whatever information it gets from the website(s) you're connecting to.

### PHP, on the other hand, runs on the same computer as the website you're visiting, which is known as the server. This means that it has access to all the information and files on that machine, which allows it to construct custom HTML pages to send to your browser, handle cookies, and run tasks or perform calculations with data from that website.

### PHP code can be written right into your HTML. Make sure to end your line of PHP code with a semicolon.

### Our main file is now index.php instead of index.html. This is important! It tells the PHP interpreter that there's PHP code in the file to evaluate.

## PHP Syntax

### The `echo` function outputs strings.

### The concatenation operator is just a dot (`.`). (If you're coming to PHP from JavaScript, the dot does the same thing for strings that `+` does in JavaScript.)

### In addition to outputting strings, PHP can also do math.

### All variable names in PHP start with a dollar sign ( `$` ).

### PHP Comments are `//`

### No `""` around the numbers when they are being declared variables.
